      <p>"Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever." There could be many sequels of good movies, but this one is just a giantic step up from many others, telling the story of Vito Corleone could not be any better, performanced by Robert de Niro, which gave him an Oscar is just unforgettable and leaded by the new Don by Al Pacino, is just perfect, with more than 3 hours long, you do not feel the time pass as the story delivers one of the best films in movie history.</p>

      <p>"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship". For many people, Casablanca is the best picture ever shown, from the theme "As time goes by" really is something different while the characters start to feel something for the other one, it was a hit at the time and nowadays is still considered pure cult cinema, for many it has the most beaufiful and full of hope end, and for some, it is just a sad end, but the only think that we are sure, is that it is a Must Watch for everyone.</p>

      <p>"I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse". We are talking about pure cinema, we are talking about a real masterpice, we are talking about 2 of the best actors ever in a film, Marlon Brando delivered probably the best character in movie history and Al Pacino embraced to follow his steps as Vito Corleone's son. Jimmy Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, could it be possibly a better cast? We do not think so. The Godfather will be forever remembered as the best film ever, directed by the magnificent Francis Ford Coppola and written by Mario Puzo, this film tells the story of the Corleone family struggling by other families in New York in order to survive from chaos and disorder, there are so many sequences and quotes that will live forever, but let's face it, "The Godfather" is THE FILM.</p>
