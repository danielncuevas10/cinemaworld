      <p>Biopics have been around for a many long time, and to me honest, not all of them are good, there were a lot of expectations with Rocket Man when it was presented to cinemas, and definetely it did not let us down, this is a the perfect example of ho a biopic must be and also what a musical must be, it has so much power, hope, music and joyness.</p>
