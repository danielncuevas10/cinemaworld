    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Probably one of the first Romantic Comedies ever, this film gave us for the very first time the outstanding charm of Audry Hepburn with the amazing Gregory Peck as a leading character too, this story is about a pricess that goes all over the world and suddenly decides to leave the routine and explore Rome, a beautiful film for everyone and just enjoy the moments.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It is not a surprise that this book won the Pulitzer, and it is known as one of the best books ever published when first appeared in 1960, written by Harper Lee. Many times the movies do not get the passion and the feeling of a book , but the film directed by Robert Mulligan truly captured everthing from it, this is a story of a lawyer portrayed by Gregory Peck, that is defending a black person that is being accused by something that he did not do, but it is lived by 2 boys that do not understand what is going on, it is really worth to watch for everyone.</p>

      <p>Many people have watched a picture or a video of James Dean, and definitely it is from "Rebel Without a Cause", it delivers chills in every way and what is life from a teenager point of view, this must be a film to watch for every teenager in order to know what to do and that we all live and have difficult moments in life.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>"I coul'da been a contender!". It is one of the most important quotes in cinema, said by one of the most important actors ever (probably the best) in a film that shows us again, what is a life of a teenager that is just following his dreams but it gets frustated by difficulties of life, many films have been inspired by this quote, including the masterpiece by Martin Scorsese "Raging Bull". "On the waterfront" will forever be remembered and truly showed us who Marlon Brando was. </p>

      <p>It is just impossible not to shed a tear in this film, when a hopeless man just decides that life is not worth it, an angel shows him what is the true meaning of life and what we all do, evemthough we could think that we are not important, the people around us just love us and we all have done something for someone eventhough we did not notice it, this fil just captures what life is and give us chills to keep doing what we love.</p>

      <p>"Rosebud", the mistery of the last word of a person is what the movie is all about, with many people just imagining so many things about what it could meant. Orson Welles starts and directs this classic, and probably, is the best debut for a director in cinema history.</p>

      <p>This story is based on a difficult period in history, when many things just seem to be more difficult, but this was not a problem to find love in places that we thought impossible. Casablanca also delivered us one of the most significant endings ever.</p>
