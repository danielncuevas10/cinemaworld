      <p>We all have watched Hitler's best days, we know the tyrant, the political animal and the dictator, but what we know less, are the last days in his bunker, when Germany was doomed to loose the World War II, "Der Untergang) narrates the last days of Hitler in a terrific way, showing the man that most of us do not know, a small guy having ego problems when the soldiers already didn't listen to him and already knew that he had lost his head, completely gone mad.</p>

      <p>It is impossible not to mention another masterpiece directed by Steven Spielber, "Lincoln" can not be any better, not just because the story is terrificly written, but because Daniel Day-Lewis gave one of his best performances, method acting just gave us a performance that will last forever as what acting must be.</p>

      <p>If there is a question that asks: What is the meaning of Cinema? Definetely we must say "Lawrence of Arabia", the king og kings, the epic of all epics, the definition of a masterpiece, this film tells the story of T.E. Lawrence, a story based on his own writting, where he acts and fought as a warrior alongside Arab guerrilla forces in the Middle East during the First World War. If this is not enough to convince you, you should probaly consider that if yo like cinematography and would like to watch probably the best shots of a film ever recorded, this is the one, this is the only one. </p>
